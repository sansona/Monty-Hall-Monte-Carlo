# Monty-Hall-Monte-Carlo
Script to study Monty Hall-like problems. Given k correct doors, m total doors, and n revealed doors, for which (k, m, n) does it not make sense to switch? Utilize random sampling (Monte Carlo) to study large number of different (K, M, N) to study patterns in convergence.

Usage:
```
./monty_hall.py [-K] [-M] [-N] [-n_iter] 

Optional: [-p plot results] [-m Monte Carlo]
```
